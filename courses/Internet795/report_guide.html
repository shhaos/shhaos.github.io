	  <p>Paper reviews 
		  Homework for the course primarily consists of writing a reflection upon each paper you read. In general you are only responsible for reading the first paper listed for a given topic. If you want to read and assess a different paper instead, clear your choice with me in advance.

Typically the assignment will be for you to sketch different facets of the paper, such as:

What are the paper's main contributions?
What parts of the paper do you find unclear? (Optional)
What parts of the paper are questionable? (E.g., methodology, omissions, relevance, presentation.)
Most homeworks will include an additional specific question or sometimes two regarding the topic, such as challenging you to come up with and defend a proposed solution.

Submit your writeup via email as PDF.

	  <p><h4><b>Final Report</b></h4>
		  <p>A Similar  is the <b><i>Systematizing Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)</i></b>, which has been introduced by the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) since 2010. 
			  
			  <div class="well well-sm"><i>... soliciting papers focused on systematization of knowledge (SoK). The goal of this call is to encourage work that evaluates, systematizes, and contextualizes existing knowledge. These papers will provide a high value to our community but would otherwise not be accepted because they lack novel research contributions. Suitable papers include survey papers that provide useful perspectives on major research areas, papers that support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or papers that provide an extensive and realistic evaluation of competing approaches to solving specific problems.</i></div>
			  
			  <p>A collection of SoK papers from the IEEE S&P can be found <a href="https://oaklandsok.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
		  
	  <p><h4><b>Homework and Final Report</b></h4>
		  <p>Homework is submitted as (three) paper reviews for the papers studied in the class. The Final report is a survey paper for a specific topic within the scope of the course.
